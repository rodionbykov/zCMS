There's lots of frameworks for PHP development, however back in 200x our team and I came up with custom PHP barebone website. We all know how developers hate other developers' code ! And back in time, Zend Framework or CakePHP weren't around. Barebone means that code implements basic functions, that every web-site require to operate. We built on top of Fusebox framework to implement MVC pattern and polished code until it becomes simple content management system.

Project is suitable for building site of any size. Witn ZiostCMS you may hit the ground running when creating simple content-based websites. Feel free to download code off Bitbucket Mercurial repository.
